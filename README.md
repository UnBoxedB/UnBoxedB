👋 Hi, I’m @UnBoxedB<br><br>
👀 My two main interests about which I am not only intellectually curious but also deeply passionate include<br>
  1.  HCI+UI+AI which for me means making knowledge not only accessible but ultimately fully integrated between/among/into human and machine.  Some topics that fall within this realm:
   - personal AI assistants that have full knowledge of their human partner
   - body integrated interfaces
   - knowledge graphing
   - data storage and retrieval
   - biological authentication
   - the effect of speaking politely to LLMs on the output received <br>
  2.  Socio-Spiritual frameworks for a future of abundance, meaning the structures we will need to have in place as soon as 1-2 more doubling periods along the AI exponential curve have occured and AI+robotics are so advanced that both work and money as we currently understand them will be completely irrelevant and nonsensical.<br><br>
Additional interests (intellectually interesting but not passion inducing) include:<br>
- cybersecurity
- deep fake detection
- extremely diverse LLM training datasets
- highly specific LLM training datasets<br><br>
🌱 I’m currently learning how to learn faster and more efficiently but learning how to most effectively communicate with LLMs<br><br>
💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects involving intelligent agents for learning and knowledge acquisition, storage, analysis, retrieval and sharing<br><br>
